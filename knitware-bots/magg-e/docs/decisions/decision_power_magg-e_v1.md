# Power Architecture Selection – MAGG.e™ v1

## 1. Overview

This document captures the rationale behind the selection and assignment of power sources for the MAGG.e™v1 prototype. The robot comprises two onboard compute subsystems (Pi2 + BrickPi3; Pi5 + stereo camera), along with a servo gimbal for head articulation. Reliable, safe, and efficient power delivery was a design priority.

*Headroom = Output capacity minus Input requirement*


**Design Note:** DC2 (19.5V) is used instead of DC1 to keep the latter available for charging the power bank while the system remains powered.

### Servo Control Channel Plan

- Servo PWM control will be driven from the **Pi5’s GPIO**, using either:
  - A direct GPIO PWM signal
  - Or via a driver like the **PCA9685** over I²C
- Power and logic **grounds will be tied** between Pi5 and servo board to ensure reference stability
- Servo power will be kept electrically **isolated from Pi5’s power rail** to avoid noise or load interference

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                       | Mitigation |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| Pi5 power delivery constraints              | Replaced USB-C PD with 19.5V DC2 + high-current 5V buck converter (leaves DC1 free for charging) with USB-C output |
| Servo stalls causing USB-A dropouts        | Limit gimbal speed; add local capacitor smoothing to absorb stall transients |
| BrickPi peak draw on YB120300              | Avoid simultaneous stall conditions; monitor thermal and current headroom on BrickPi3 |
| Shared ground instability                  | Tie all GND rails at a common point; test for potential ground loops in hardware-in-the-loop |
| Increased total mass affects balance agility | Raise CoM for better inverted pendulum control; keep total weight <1.5 kg; constrain top speed and tilt |

## 6. Future Considerations

- Consider building integrated dual-rail power board with telemetry and soft-fused outputs
- Log power usage over time to inform runtime estimators and future pack sizing
- Evaluate unified power solution with dual isolated DC-DC converters in a custom enclosure
